# Corifi ([κορυφή](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%85%CF%86%CE%AE))

A naive C compiler written in Rust.

ANSI C is the target of this project, and [ACSL 1.2](https://frama-c.com/download/acsl_1.2.pdf) (by FramaC) is the specification that this will be based on.

### Q: Why Corify?
A: This is always going to be a bleeding edge project just like the peak of a mountain.

### Q: Should I use this?
A: Nope, stay as far away as possible :^)

### Q: Why is this made?
A: I am practicing my language making skills, and I decided that I will start with a C compiler.
